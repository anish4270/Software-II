# Software-II Project
This software was release one and has the following bugs:
the compare operations on the linked list are string to string and dateformat to dateformat, this is difficult with java
uses SimpleDateFormat instead of date
for summing up the total value of the order the loop starts at the top and works backwards, doesnt work at all
fixes can be found in release 2
