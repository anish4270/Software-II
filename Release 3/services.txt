The two functionalities we decided to work on with this app are ordering food and making a reservation. For the refactoring stage we decided to deploy these two functionalities to services. for building the api we used springboot service and postman to test out the functionality.
we created two controller trycontroller.java and usercontroller ,java to perform the functionality. We had to make some changes to our code to make it work for the services. We used request mapping to post new data. We also performed get, post put. We used a small local database for the code to work.
